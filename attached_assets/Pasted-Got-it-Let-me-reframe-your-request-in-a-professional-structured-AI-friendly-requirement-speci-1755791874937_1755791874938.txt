Got it üëç Let me reframe your request in a **professional, structured, AI-friendly requirement specification** so that any developer or AI tool can clearly understand and implement it efficiently.

### **Requirement Specification: Fruit Weightage Recording & Billing System**

#### **Problem Statement**

The current system has issues with:

1. **Bill Printing & Downloading** ‚Äì The generated bills are not printing or downloading properly.
2. **Weightage Recording** ‚Äì The recording of fruit weights is not fully integrated with the billing system.
3. **Multi-Level Weight Recording** ‚Äì The system should support both **single tonnage entries** and **multiple crate-based entries**.
4. **Category-wise Aggregation** ‚Äì Fruits such as *mango* can have multiple types (e.g., **by size and by variety**) which must be recorded separately but aggregated in billing.

---

#### **Functional Requirements**

1. **Weightage Recording**

   * Allow recording of fruits by:

     * **Single Tonnage** (e.g., 1 ton of mangoes).
     * **Multiple Crates** (e.g., 10 crates of mangoes, each with individual weights).
   * System should calculate the **total weight per fruit category**, summing across different types/sizes.

2. **Billing Integration**

   * Link recorded weightage directly with the billing system.
   * Billing should:

     * Display itemized details by fruit type/size.
     * Calculate total quantity (weight) and corresponding charges.
     * Support aggregated totals per fruit (e.g., all mango varieties combined).

3. **Bill Printing & Downloading**

   * Ensure proper **PDF generation** with clean formatting.
   * Include:

     * Date & Time
     * Customer Details
     * Fruit Type, Variety/Size, Weight (tonnage or crates), Unit Price, and Subtotal
     * Grand Total (across all fruits).
   * Provide options to:

     * **Download as PDF**
     * **Print directly**

---

#### **Example Case**

* **Input:**

  * Mango ‚Äì Large Size ‚Äì 200 kg
  * Mango ‚Äì Medium Size ‚Äì 150 kg
  * Mango ‚Äì Small Size ‚Äì 100 kg
  * Apple ‚Äì 250 kg

* **Expected Output (Bill):**

  ```
  -------------------------------------------------
  Customer: XYZ Traders
  Date: 21-Aug-2025

  Itemized Details:
  - Mango (Large)    : 200 kg √ó Rate ‚Üí Subtotal
  - Mango (Medium)   : 150 kg √ó Rate ‚Üí Subtotal
  - Mango (Small)    : 100 kg √ó Rate ‚Üí Subtotal
  - Apple            : 250 kg √ó Rate ‚Üí Subtotal

  Total Mango Weight : 450 kg
  Grand Total        : XXXX

  -------------------------------------------------
  ```

---

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Accuracy**: All weights and totals must be calculated precisely.
* **Usability**: User-friendly interface for quick data entry.
* **Reliability**: Bills must download/print without failure.

‚úÖ This structured version clearly outlines **what needs to be fixed** (billing + printing), **what needs to be added** (multi-crate + aggregation), and **how the system should behave** (linked recording + professional billing).

Would you like me to also **create a system flow diagram / data model** (entities like Fruit ‚Üí Type ‚Üí Weight ‚Üí Billing) so it‚Äôs easier for an AI tool or developer to implement directly?
